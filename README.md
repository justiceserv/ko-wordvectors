# Korean Pre-trained Word Vectors 
This repository is basically a fork of [Kyubyong/wordvectors](https://github.com/Kyubyong/wordvectors), but with newer data and better compatibility. 

With the project being more than 6 Years old, it had some problems with the latest [Gensim compatibility](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70458726/cant-load-the-pre-trained-word2vec-of-korean-language).

This project used 20231220 kowiki Database dump, corpus size 100M.
